# Morse Code game on Micro::bit

## Descrption

A fun little game that you can play on our Micro:bit. The board will show a word that has some missing letters, the job of the player is to enter the Morse code of those missing one into the Micro::bit to win the game.

### Links

Access the game through [this makecode site](https://makecode.microbit.org/47415-21662-25975-78988)

### Techs

- Languages: JavaScript
- IDE: [makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org)

### What I've learned

- Coded with a mini-controller
- Exposed to game design
- Made used of lesson I learned at school - bitmasking - to generate random blank of the word
- Strengthened JavaScript developing skills

## How to install

There are 2 approaches to play this game, either you play it on your physical Micro::bit or give it a try with a virtual one. If the latter sounds right to you, you can skip this part to
Required components: Micro::bit, 2 alligator wires
Step-by-step instruction:

1. download the executable file from [the makecode site](https://makecode.microbit.org/47415-21662-25975-78988)
2. connect your Micro::bit to your computer and a new external driver will show up to indicate a successful connection
3. drag the downloaded file to the driver, your Micro::bit by the time should flashing its LED to indicate the transmission has been running
4. connect one alligator wire to pin 0, and another to the ground pin.
5. Restart your Micro::bit before you start playing (button at the back of the Micro::bit)

## How to play

Starting the game, an icon will be displayed on the LED board as a hint of the word you will guess.
a string of letters showing up have some missing letters, you will need to enter the Morse code of that blank letter by tapping the 2 alligator wires you have connected to the board: long tap should last for 1 second to indicate a "-" and shorter tap for ".".

You don't have to filling the code in order of its letter in the word. Do not let the machine wait too long because It will automatically submit the answer for you, for every correct input, it will show a tick and cross for the wrong one.

There are 3 rounds in this game. A heart icon will be shown up as a congratulation to you pass for a round.  Good luck!
